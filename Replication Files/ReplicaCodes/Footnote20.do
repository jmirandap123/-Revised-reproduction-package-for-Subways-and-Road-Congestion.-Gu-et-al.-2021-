*/ This regression is not addressed much in the paper since it is a footer, however what is sought to estimate is the average distance weighted by the population to the nearest metro line calculated as the average
distance from the TAZ to the nearest metro line weighted by population. */

*/ The base model includes the terms (1) lndistl and (2) ) Postgw*lndistl, which represent the logarithmic distance to the treated metro line (for segments in treated cities) or control (for segments in control cities) and possible heterogeneous trends for road segments with different distances from the metro line.*/
